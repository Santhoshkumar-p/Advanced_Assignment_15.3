Create a service, which will store an object of task in your current component
and then make a link on the same view and when the user clicks,
it should go to the next page and show that task object data in view.

Notes:

Angular CLI is used to create app. So, use ng serve to run on localhost:4200
Used the Todo List example created by https://github.com/resolvethis/ng2-todo
Added an edit todo component
Modified the todo item component, so that user can check off item as completed and NOT archive it
and conversely, can archive it without completing it
Modified the service method removeItem to accomodate the completed flag Also, added a getItem by id for the EditComponent
For this assignment the EditComponent doesn't actually let user change anything, just view it
Also, modified the todo list so that each todo task has an <a> tag to take user to view the selected todo item
Code structure:
app-root
todo-page, archive-page
todo-page:
new-todo, todo-list
todo-item, edit-todo
archive-page:
archive-list, edit-todo
